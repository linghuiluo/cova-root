# COVA - Constraint Analysis with VASCO
We respect the double blind review process and removed information such as author and institution names in source code to maintain the author anonymity. 

- The directory `cova` contains the source code of COVA.
- The directory `constraintBench` contains the micro-benchmark used for COVA.
- The lists of constraint-APIs can be found in directory `cova/config/`: Configuration_APIs.txt, UICallback_APIs.txt and IO_APIs.txt
- The tests for running constraintBench for COVA can be found in directory `cova/src/test/java/constraintBenchTestSuite.`

## How to Build COVA?
COVA is implemented as a maven project. However, since some dependencies COVA uses do not have public maven repositories, you need to follow the steps below:

## 1. Bind Z3 Library
COVA uses Z3 for STM-Solving and you need at first to bind Z3 for running the tool or use a [docker image](/cova/config/Dockerfile.txt) (tested on Linux). 
You can find Z3-4.5.0 in the local directory `$REPO_LOCATION/cova/localLibs/` or downloand it from [the GitHub repostiory of Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).  
### - Windows
Currently, the repository only includes Z3 for Windows 64bit.
There are two choices for you to bind z3:

- **Userwide via OS**: 
Add `$REPO_LOCATION/cova/localLibs/z3-4.5.0-x64-win/bin` to the system variable `PATH` of your operating system ([How do I set or change the PATH system variable?](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml)). You may need to retart your OS. 

- **Projectwide in Eclipse**: 
After importing COVA as maven project, you can specify the environment variable: 
> Eclipse > Run > Run Configurations > Environment > New  
Name: `PATH`  
Value: `$REPO_LOCATION/cova/localLibs/z3-4.5.0-x64-win/bin`


### - Linux
Currently, the repository only inclues Z3 for Ubuntu and Debian-8.5 64bit.

- **Userwide via OS**:  
Add the **LD_LIBRARY_PATH** Variable to .profile in your home directory and load that file to your current Environment:  
`echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$REPO_LOCATION/cova/localLibs/z3-4.5.0-x64-ubuntu/bin"" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile`

- **Projectwide in Eclipse**:  
After importing COVA as maven project, you can specify the environment variable:
> Eclipse > Run > Run Configurations > Environment > New  
Name: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`  
Value: `$REPO_LOCATION/cova/localLibs/z3-4.5.0-x64-ubuntu/bin` 

### - OSX
You need to add Z3 to `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (untested)

## 2.1 Build The Tool With Maven
- Install required local dependencies into your local maven repository with the script ``install_local_libs.*`` in `$REPO_LOCATION/cova/localLibs` (Windows using `install_local_libs.bat` or Linux using `install_local_libs.sh`). 
- run `mvn install` to build the tool and run all tests.
- If you want to skip tests just run `mvn -DskipTests install`

## 2.2 Build The Tool with Eclipse
- Install required local dependencies into your local maven repository with the script ``install_local_libs.*`` in `$REPO_LOCATION/cova/localLibs` (Windows using `install_local_libs.bat` or Linux using `install_local_libs.sh`). 
- Simply import the project as maven project. Maven should take care of all reqired dependences.
> Eclipse> File> Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects > *Enter the path to your local repository*  > Finish

## 3. Running The Command-Line Tool 
- Make sure you have JAVA 8 installed and bound Z3. 
- Run the executable jar with JAVA: ``java -jar cova.jar`` .
- You can run COVA with the option ``-android`` to get all options for analyzing an Android application or with the option ``-java`` for normal Java application.
- Here is an example explained step by step:

(1) **Together with FlowDroid** (Default):

You can use COVA combined with FLowDroid to get the constraints under which a leak reported by FlowDroid may happen. 

Run cova with the following options (put after ``java -jar cova.jar``):

``-android -config <config files path> -p <android platform path> -apk <apk file>``

   for testing this you can find: 
   - config files:``$REPO_LOCATION\cova\config``
   - android platforms (API 26-27): ``$REPO_LOCATION\cova\src\test\resources\androidPlatforms``
   - an example apk:``$REPO_LOCATION\constraintBench\androidApps\apks\Callbacks1.apk``

   The results are in JSON files located in ``$WORKING_DIRECTORY\covaOutput\jsonOutput``

(2) **Standalone**:

You can run COVA in standalone mode with the option ``s``. In this mode a constraint map will be computed. If you have the java source code of your application, you can get the constraint map printed next to each line of code in HTML sites with the option ``Ã²utput_html``. 

Run cova with the following options:

``-android -config <config files path> -p <android platform path> -apk <apk file> -s "true" -output_html <source code path>``

   for testing this you can find: 
   - config files:``$REPO_LOCATION\cova\config``
   - android platforms (API 26-27): ``$REPO_LOCATION\cova\src\test\resources\androidPlatforms``
   - an example apk:``$REPO_LOCATION\constraintBench\androidApps\apks\Callbacks1.apk``
   - source code of this apk: ``$REPO_LOCATION\constraintBench\androidApps\sourceCode\Callbacks1``

   The results are in HTML files located in ``$WORKING_DIRECTORY\covaOutput\htmlOutput``
